## About Crayons

Crayons is a component library based on Web Components. The goal of Crayons is to provide developers with easy to use web components that give apps a Freshworks product like user interface, while reducing the number of lines of code. Crayons is developed using StencilJS that helps build standard-based Web Components.

    |  docs     |   Documentation only changes |
    |  style    |   Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code(white-space, formatting, missing      semi-colons, etc) |
    |  refactor |   A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
    |  perf     |   A code change that improves performance |

    |  ci       |   Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs) |
